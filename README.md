## Integrating Augmented Reality within Digital Twins for Smart Robotic Manufacturing Systems ##


This repository contains files for the paper titled "Integrating Augmented Reality within Digital Twins for Smart Robotic Manufacturing Systems," with Tomáš Jochman as the main author. This paper explores integrating augmented reality into robotic manufacturing systems to enhance connectivity, real-time data processing, and interactive visual interfaces. Using Hololens 2 headsets with OPC UA clients, the system directly interfaces operators with digital and physical manufacturing components. The architecture leverages augmented reality for advanced operational control and visualization in tasks such as multi-axis additive manufacturing, robotic sanding, and screwing with integrated cameras. This integration advances manufacturing processes by enabling interactive operator engagement, optimizing workflows, and improving precision and efficiency in a smart factory setting.
